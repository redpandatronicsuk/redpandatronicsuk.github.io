The internet is evolving quickly and it is hard to keep up to date with the latest technologies. For all products we design, we make sure we are using the latest and best suited technologies that are out there. As we learn about new things, we like to blog about them to share what we have learned. We work on our own products, but also often work on projects from industry or academic partners. </p> </div> <div class="col-lg-6"> <h3>Hardware development</h3> <p style="line-height: 1"> The hobby electronics field has had a huge popularity increase in the recent years. This is mainly due to the release of amazing products, such as the Arduino and RaspberryPi. In the blog you can find posts about hobby projects we have been working on. We also work with academic partners and other businesses on small hardware based projects. For enquiries if we could help your business or academic project please drop us an email. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row marketing"> <div class="col-lg-6"> <h3>Webdesign</h3> <p style="line-height: 1"> We are full stack developers, meaning we do front-end to back-end web development and anything in-between. From many of the projects we work on, we try to make reusable components, for things we can't use an already existing component and have to develop our own. We like to share these components with the community. You will find links to the Github repositories where we host these projects and descriptions on how to use them. Most of the time these are reusable components, mainly Angular directives. However, the projects we share is not limited to reusable components. </p> </div> <div class="col-lg-6"> <h3>Efficiency</h3> <p style="line-height: 1"> Efficiency is one of our top priorities when it comes to building software. We do not shy away from technologies that are harder too use or maintain, if they offer great efficiency. We often compare competing technologies and evaluate them on usability, feature-richness and most importantly efficiency. We regularly blog about our findings to share with the community and get feedback from experienced users. </p> </div> </div> <div> <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="setFont('PRINC');">PRINC</button> <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="setFont('FuturaLightBT');">FuturaLightBT</button> <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="setFont('LACURG');">LACURG</button> <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="setFont('ostrichregular');">ostrichregular</button> <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="setFont('proximanovalight');">proximanovalight</button> </div>
