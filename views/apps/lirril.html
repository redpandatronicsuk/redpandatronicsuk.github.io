Researchers at Carnegie Melon University conducted an experiment on teaching native Japanese speakers differentiate between L and R sounds. Participants were played words with /l/r/ ambiguity, such as ‘play’ – ‘pray’, or ‘long’ – ‘wrong’, and asked to pick the word they heard. At first the participants were not shown whether their answers were correct or wrong, and they scored an average of 50%, which is no better than mere guessing.</p> <p>LiRRiL is an app based on scientific research that helps non-native English speakers who are experiencing problems differentiating L and R sounds.

Japanese, on the other hand, has a liquid flap consonant that varies between a lateral [ɺ] and central [ɾ] sounds <sup>1</sup> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_of_/r/_and_/l/_by_the_Japanese" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>]. In western languages, such as English for example, we have two very distinctive sounds for L and R, which linguists denote with /l/ and [ɹ]. This leads to that native Japanese speakers, who haven't learned a language, such as English, at a very young age will have difficulties hearing and producing western L and R sounds accurately. The confusion of L and R sounds is often referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lallation" target="_blank" translate="">lallation</a>. </p> <h3>The brain tunes-in on language specific sounds at a very young age</h3> <p>A language is composed of many parts. We speak in sentences, which are made up of words. The ordering of words within a sentence is governed by the grammar used by a particular language. Words, on the other hand, are composed of phonetic sounds. There are about 6500 different languages in the world, which use about 150 different phonetic sounds. No language of course contains all 150 sounds, in English for example, we use only 44 phonemes.</p> <p> It is obvious to everybody that you need to know the vocabulary of a language, or at least a few words, before you can start making sentences. Research has confirmed though that before we can learn the words of a language, the first step is to learn the sounds which make up the words. This is easily done by the brain when it is still in an early development stage, but later on in life, the brain diverts its energy to other parts and picking up foreign sounds becomes much harder.

Recent research has uncovered the secret to teach the developed brain how to learn new sounds [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/ling290e/lively_et_al_1994.pdf"> Lively &amp; Pisoni </a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/McCFiezMcCandliss02.pdf"> McClelland, Fiez &amp; McCandliss </a>]. Several techniques were tried out in these studies, but only one technique proved to work. The secret to learning new sounds is to provide an instant feedback loop. This means that whenever you submit an answer to whether you heard an L or R sound, you are given immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct or wrong. Through the immediate feedback, your brain will develop the mechanisms it needs to accurately distinguish between these sounds. </p> <p> In the above study (<a target="_blank" href="http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/papers/McCFiezMcCandliss02.pdf"> McClelland, Fiez &amp; McCandliss </a>) a control group was used to confirm the results are genuine. The control group was given the same task, to distinguish between L and R ambiguous words, but they did not receive the immediate feedback whether their answer was right or wrong. They were only told after the experiment which answers were correct and which were wrong. Because they did not receive the immediate feedback, they made no improvements and retained an accuracy of 50%. </p> <p> The group that received the immediate feedback after each submitted answer, was able to score an average of 80% accuracy after just 30 minutes of training! Yet another study [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472521/" target="_blank">Bradlow, Akahane-Yamada, Pisoni, Tohkura</a>] found that distinguishing L and R sounds also improves the speakers ability to produce/pronounce these words. The study also showed that the newly learned ability stays with you for the long-term. After 6 months without practicing their accuracy began to slightly drop again. With LiRRiL you do not need to worry about that, because you have the app on your phone ,or tablet, you can take it with you wherever you are and squeeze in a little learning session when you are waiting for a bus, for example. </p> <p> Computer Scientists make use of a similar technique, known as reinforcement learning, to teach computers how to distinguish between various things.

We here at RedPandaTronics (the awesome company behind LiRRiL), believe in the effectiveness of our products and therefore let you try our free version with 3 speakers and 17 word pairs for FREE. The ad free Pro version offers more speakers and 85 word pairs, to further improve your L and R sound distinguishing ability. For those that want even more speakers, with an even wider range of accents, we also have the Deluxe version, which also incorporates the Endless Mode, so you can continue improving your understanding of western phonemes non-stop! </p> <h3>Same technique other phonemes and languages</h3> <p> Are you learning a new language and are experiencing difficulties in understanding it? Please let us know at <a style="text-decoration: none; color: white" href="mailto:lirril@redpandatronics.com?Subject=New Language" target="_top">lirril@redpandatronics.com</a>! You can be in contact with our development team and offer suggestions on how we can improve LiRRiL for you. As a reward, any customer that recommends us a new language, will get free access to the Deluxe version when it becomes available. </p> <h4>Footnotes</h4> <ol id="footnotes"> <li>[ɺ], [ɾ], ..., are symbols used by linguists to denote different sounds.</li> </ol></div>
